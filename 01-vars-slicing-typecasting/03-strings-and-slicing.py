# unlike low level languages,
# strings are not a nightmare here!

# let's write an <a> html tag 
tag = '<a href="https://github.com/aliaryani-security">Github page</a>'
# as you can see, using single quote or double quote
# does not matter, they both can do the job
# but be careful not to ruin your own code !
# in the example above, we cannot use double
# quotes, since we have a pair of double quotes
# right in the middle of our string! in href value
